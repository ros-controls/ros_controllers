   * \brief Quadratic Meas(urement) Covariance Model
   *
   * The odometry covariance is computed using a similar model to the one
   * presented in:
   *
   * [Siegwart, 2004]:
   *   Roland Siegwart, Illah R. Nourbakhsh
   *   Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots
   *   1st Edition, 2004
   *
   * Section:
   *   5.2.4 'An error model for odometric position estimation' (pp. 186-191)
   *
   * Although the twist covariance doesn't appear explicitly, the implementation
   * here is based on the same covariance model used for the pose covariance.
   *
   * Instead of using the std::abs of the wheel position increment dp, this
   * model uses the squared (quadratic) value of dp, so the proportional term
   * (multiplied by k_*_) does NOT depend on the control period dt (see
   * explanation below).
   *
   * This is important because it makes the covariance model independent of
   * the control period dt. Since dp = v * dt, the variance actually gives:
   *
   *   dp^2 = (v * dt)^2 = v^2 * dt^2
   *
   * where dt^2 gets cancelled when the covariance propagation for the twist
   * is applied, i.e. the 1/dt jacobians pre- and post-multiply this
   * covariance model, so the control perdio dt cancels out:
   *
   *   (1/dt) * dt^2 * (1/dt) = dt^2 / dt^2 = 1
   *
   * The model also includes the wheel resolution, as a constant additive
   * diagonal covariance, that can be easily disabled by using a zero
   * (ideal/perfect) wheel resolution.
   *
   * If the wheel resolution (DC offset) term is used, the covariance model
   * would again vary with the control period dt because the wheel
   * resolution is constant and does NOT include/depend on dt.

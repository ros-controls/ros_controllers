0.6.0 (2014-02-05)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#72 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/72>`_ from pal-robotics/minor-maintenance
  Minor maintenance
* Default stop_trajectory_duration to zero. Refs `#73 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/73>`_
* Better logs when dropping traj points. Refs `#68 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/68>`_.
* Fix class member reorder warning in constructor.
* Add missing headers to target files.
* Action interface rejects empty goals. Fixes `#70 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/70>`_.
* Reorder how time and traj data are updated.
  In the update method, fetching the currently executed trajectory should be done
  before updating the time data to prevent a potential scenario in which there
  is no trajectory defined for the current control cycle.
* Work tolerance checking methods.
  Until now we used the currently active goal handle for performing tolerance
  checks. Using the goal handle stored in segments is more robust to unexpected
  goal updates by the non-rt thread.
* Refactor how the currrent trajectory is stored.
  - Handle concurrency in the current trajectory between rt and non-rt threads
  using the simpler RealtimeBox instead of the RealtimeBuffer, because our
  usecase does not fit well the non-rt->writes / rt->reads semantics.
  - As a consequence we no longer need to store the msg_trajectory member, but
  only the hold_trajectory, which must still be preallocated.
* Honor unspecified vel/acc in ROS message. Fix `#65 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/65>`_.
* Fixes per Adolfo
* Added verbose flag
* Fixing realtime issues
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into joint_trajectory_tweaks
* Tweaked error messages
* Added more debug info
* Fix for microsecond delay that caused header time=0 (now) to start too late
* Reworded debug message
* Image update.
* Update README.md
  Factor out user documentation to the ROS wiki.
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/willowgarage/ros_controllers into hydro-devel
* Rename hold_trajectory_duration
  - hold_trajectory_duration -> stop_trajectory_duration for more clarity.
  - During Hydro, hold_trajectory_duration will still work, giving a deprecation
  warning.
* Add basic description in package.xml.
* Add images used in the ROS wiki doc.
* Added better debug info
* Throttled debug output
* Added more debug and error information
* Contributors: Adolfo Rodriguez Tsouroukdissian, Dave Coleman

0.5.4 (2013-09-30)
------------------
* Added install rules for plugin.xml
* Remove PID sign flip.
  This is now done in the state error computation.
* Merge pull request `#45 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_controllers/issues/45>`_ from ros-controls/effort_fixes
  Added check for ~/robot_description and fixed hardware interface abstraction bug
* Flip state error sign.
* PID sign was wrong
* Added check for ~/robot_description and fixed hardware interface abstraction bug
* Update README.md
* Create README.md
* Fix license header string for some files.
* Less verbose init logging.
  Statement detailing controller joint count, as well as segment and hardware
  interface types moved from INFO to DEBUG severity.

0.5.3 (2013-09-04)
------------------
* joint_trajectory_controller: New package implementing a controller for executing joint-space trajectories on a
  set of joints.

  * ROS API

    * Commands: FollowJointTrajectory action and trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectory topic.
    * Current controller state is available in a control_msgs::JointTrajectoryControllerState topic.
    * Controller state at any future time can be queried through a control_msgs::JointTrajectoryControllerState
      service.

  * Trajectory segment type

    * Controller is templated on the segment type.
    * Multi-dof quintic spline segment implementation provided by default.

  * Hardware interface type

    * Controller is templated on the hardware interface type.
    * Position and effort control joint interfaces provided by default.

  * Other

    * Realtime-safe.
    * Proper handling of wrapping (continuous) joints.
    * Discontinuous system clock changes do not cause discontinuities in the execution of already queued
      trajectory segments.
